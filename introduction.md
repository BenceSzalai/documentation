Introduction
============

The Themosis framework is a tool aimed to WordPress developers of any levels. But the better WordPress and PHP knowledge you have the easier it is to work with.

The Themosis framework has always been inspired by the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)  framework. With the release of the version 2.0, the framework now provides better compatibility with the illuminate packages.
