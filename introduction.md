Introduction
============

The Themosis framework is a tool aimed to WordPress developers of any levels. But the better WordPress and PHP knowledge you have the easier it is to work with.

Themosis framework
------------------

Themosis framework is a tool that helps you develop websites and web applications faster using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). It helps you structure, organize your code, better manage and scale your WordPress apps using an elegant and simple code syntax.

From a technical point of view, Themosis framework is a set of APIs. It uses “modern” PHP features like anonymous functions, namespaces, is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) ready and is a mix between WordPress best practices and let’s say a typical MVC framework.

Development team
----------------
The framework was created by [Julien Lambé](http://www.themosis.com/), who continues to lead the development.

More details about contributing to the framework will be posted once it is released.
