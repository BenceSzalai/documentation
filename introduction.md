Introduction
============

The Themosis framework is a tool aimed to WordPress developers of any levels. But the better WordPress and PHP knowledge you have the easier it is to work with.

Themosis framework
------------------

Themosis framework is a tool to help you develop websites and web applications faster using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). Using an elegant and simple code syntax, Themosis framework helps you structure and organize your code and allows you to better manage and scale your WordPress websites and applications.

From a technical point of view, Themosis framework is a set of API. It uses “modern” PHP features like anonymous functions, namespaces, is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) ready and is a mix between WordPress best practices and let’s say a typical MVC framework.

The Themosis framework is born to give WordPress developers the development joy found in the [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) framework to WordPress development. As WordPress developers, you are happy by definition. Now with the Themosis framework you'll be happier and you'll be able to provide more features to your projects in less time.

Development team
----------------
The framework was created by [Julien Lambé](http://www.themosis.com/), who continues to lead the development.

More details about contributing to the framework will be posted once the stable release is out. But you can already help by reporting any code issue you may find with the Github issues system of the [themosis/framework](https://github.com/themosis/framework/issues) repository and apply the `bug` label to it so we can review it.
