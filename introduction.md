Introduction
============

The Themosis framework is a tool aimed to WordPress developers of any levels. But the better WordPress and PHP knowledge you have the easier it is to work with.

Themosis framework
------------------

Themosis framework is a tool that helps you develop custom websites and web applications faster using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). It helps you to structure, organize your code, to better manage and scale your WordPress projects using an elegant and simple code syntax.

From a technical point of view, Themosis framework is a set of APIs. It uses “modern” PHP features like anonymous functions, namespaces, is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) ready and is a mix between WordPress best practices and let’s say a typical MVC framework.

Development team
----------------
The framework was created by [Julien Lambé](http://www.themosis.com/), who continues to lead the development.

More details about contributing to the framework will be posted once the release 1.0 is out. But you can already help by reporting any code issue you may find with the Github issue system of the [themosis/themosis](https://github.com/themosis/themosis/issues) repository and apply the `bug` label to it so I can review it.
