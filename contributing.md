Themosis is an open-source project and anyone can contribute to it. Themosis  contains multiple repositories and they're all stored on Github.

If you feel confident writing code, we have 3 repositories handling the different part of the framework:

- [themosis/themosis](https://github.com/themosis/themosis): which provides the full code structure for a collaborative development installing the latest WordPress, framework plugin and theme versions.
- [themosis/framework](https://github.com/themosis/framework): which is the framework plugin containing all the core APIs.
- [themosis/theme](https://github.com/themosis/theme): which provides a dedicated code structure for developing your website/application theme.

For each of these repositories, you can accordingly assign `bug` and `feature` requests.
